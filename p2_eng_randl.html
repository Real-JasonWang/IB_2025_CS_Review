         const questions = [
             {
                 question: "What is the primary purpose of skimming a text in a reading comprehension exam?",
                 options: ["To understand every detail", "To get a general overview quickly", "To analyze complex sentence structures", "To memorize vocabulary"],
                 answer: "To get a general overview quickly",
                 explanation: "Skimming involves reading quickly to grasp the main ideas and overall structure of a text, not to understand every detail or analyze grammar in depth."
             },
             {
                 question: "When a question asks you to 'infer' something from a passage, what are you expected to do?",
                 options: ["Find information explicitly stated in the text", "Use your prior knowledge unrelated to the text", "Draw a logical conclusion based on textual evidence", "Summarize the main idea of the passage"],
                 answer: "Draw a logical conclusion based on textual evidence",
                 explanation: "Inference requires you to read between the lines and make a logical deduction based on the information provided in the text, even if it's not directly stated."
             },
             {
                 question: "Which of the following text types is LEAST likely to be found in the IB English B Paper 2 reading section?",
                 options: ["A personal blog post about a travel experience", "A formal scientific research paper with dense jargon", "An interview with a social activist", "A set of instructions for assembling a product"],
                 answer: "A formal scientific research paper with dense jargon",
                 explanation: "While diverse texts are used, highly specialized scientific papers with very dense jargon are less common than texts like articles, blogs, interviews, or instructions, which are more accessible for language learners."
             },
             {
                 question: "If a reading question asks about the 'author's tone', what should you focus on?",
                 options: ["The factual accuracy of the information presented", "The author's attitude or feeling towards the subject", "The grammatical correctness of the sentences", "The number of paragraphs in the text"],
                 answer: "The author's attitude or feeling towards the subject",
                 explanation: "The author's tone refers to their attitude or emotional stance towards the topic, which can be conveyed through word choice, imagery, and sentence structure."
             },
             {
                 question: "In a multiple-choice reading question, if two options seem correct, what is a good strategy?",
                 options: ["Choose the shorter option", "Choose the option that appears first", "Re-read the relevant part of the text carefully to find the BEST fit", "Guess randomly"],
                 answer: "Re-read the relevant part of the text carefully to find the BEST fit",
                 explanation: "Often, distractors are designed to be plausible. Carefully re-reading the text and comparing the options against the textual evidence will help identify the most accurate answer."
             },
             {
                 question: "What does 'vocabulary in context' mean in a reading exam?",
                 options: ["Knowing the dictionary definition of every word", "Understanding the meaning of a word as it is used in the specific passage", "Being able to spell all words correctly", "Identifying parts of speech"],
                 answer: "Understanding the meaning of a word as it is used in the specific passage",
                 explanation: "Context is key. Many words have multiple meanings, so you need to understand how a particular word is functioning within the sentence and paragraph it appears in."
             },
             {
                 question: "Which IB theme would a text discussing the impact of social media on teenage self-esteem most likely fall under?",

                 answer: "Problem-solution structure",
                 explanation: "This describes a common way to organize informational or persuasive texts, where a problem is identified and then potential solutions are discussed."
             },
             {
                 question: "What is the main purpose of a 'topic sentence' in a paragraph?",
                 options: ["To provide a detailed example", "To introduce the main idea of the paragraph", "To conclude the entire text", "To define a difficult word"],
                 answer: "To introduce the main idea of the paragraph",
                 explanation: "The topic sentence usually appears at or near the beginning of a paragraph and states the central point that the rest ofathe paragraph will develop."
             },
              {

                 answer: "To persuade the reader to buy a product or service",
                 explanation: "The primary purpose of most advertisements is persuasion – to convince the audience to take a specific action, usually related to a purchase."
             },

                 question: "A news report about a recent technological breakthrough would most likely connect to which IB theme?",

                 options: ["Scanning for specific dates", "Identifying the main idea of one viewpoint only", "Understanding and comparing different perspectives", "Defining vocabulary words"],
                 answer: "Understanding and comparing different perspectives",
                 explanation: "This type of question requires you to identify, understand, and then compare or contrast the different arguments or viewpoints presented in the text."
             },
             {
                 question: "What does 'scanning' a text involve in a reading exam?",

                 answer: "An incorrect option designed to seem plausible",
                 explanation: "Distractors are incorrect answer choices that are intentionally written to be attractive to test-takers who may not fully understand the material, making the question more challenging."
             },
             {
                 question: "If a question asks for the 'main idea' of a passage, what should your answer focus on?",
                 options: ["A minor detail mentioned in the text", "The most important or central point the author is making", "Your personal opinion about the topic", "The first sentence of the passage only"],
                 answer: "The most important or central point the author is making",

                 answer: "Twice",

                 explanation: "Don't get stuck on one missed point. Continue listening for other answers and make a note to pay special attention to the missed part during the second playback."

                 answer: "It can indicate the speaker's attitude, emotion, or emphasis",
                 explanation: "Intonation (rise and fall of the voice) and stress (emphasis on certain words) convey meaning beyond the literal words, such as sarcasm, excitement, or importance."
