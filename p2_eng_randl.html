                 options: ["To understand every detail", "To get a general overview quickly", "To analyze complex sentence structures", "To memorize vocabulary"],
                 answer: "To get a general overview quickly",
                 explanation: "Skimming involves reading quickly to grasp the main ideas and overall structure of a text, not to understand every detail or analyze grammar in depth."
             },
             {
                 question: "When a question asks you to 'infer' something from a passage, what are you expected to do?",

                 answer: "Draw a logical conclusion based on textual evidence",
                 explanation: "Inference requires you to read between the lines and make a logical deduction based on the information provided in the text, even if it's not directly stated."
             },

                 question: "Which of the following text types is LEAST likely to be found in the IB English B Paper 2 reading section?",

                 answer: "A formal scientific research paper with dense jargon",
                 explanation: "While diverse texts are used, highly specialized scientific papers with very dense jargon are less common than texts like articles, blogs, interviews, or instructions, which are more accessible for language learners."

                 answer: "The author's attitude or feeling towards the subject",
                 explanation: "The author's tone refers to their attitude or emotional stance towards the topic, which can be conveyed through word choice, imagery, and sentence structure."

                 answer: "Re-read the relevant part of the text carefully to find the BEST fit",
                 explanation: "Often, distractors are designed to be plausible. Carefully re-reading the text and comparing the options against the textual evidence will help identify the most accurate answer."
             },
             {
                 question: "What does 'vocabulary in context' mean in a reading exam?",

                 answer: "Understanding the meaning of a word as it is used in the specific passage",
                 explanation: "Context is key. Many words have multiple meanings, so you need to understand how a particular word is functioning within the sentence and paragraph it appears in."

             {
                 question: "Which IB theme would a text discussing the impact of social media on teenage self-esteem most likely fall under?",

                 answer: "To introduce the main idea of the paragraph",

                 answer: "Understanding and comparing different perspectives",

                 question: "If a question asks for the 'main idea' of a passage, what should your answer focus on?",
